## Literature Review

* "Socio-spatial and temporal dimensions of transport equity for London's night time economy" (McArthur, Robin, Smeds 2019) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.024
  * Goal: **inform a more rigorous mode of operationalising transport equity through sustainable and just transport planning.**
    * This paper centres on the recent introduction of Night Tube (London Underground) weekend services along selected routes to support the Night Time Economy (NTE), taking a different perspective on the NTE than most literature published to date, as it focuses on NTE workers.
    * Critical of "‘London at night’ as a vehicle for economic development, focusing on the consumption-side of the economy and improving individuals’ access to entertainment and recreation."
  * "Night-time workers face severe accessibility barriers, often relying on low-frequency bus services that have inadequate service coverage across Greater London... some social groups travel predominately during off-peak hours and are thus underserved by lower frequency services, with poor connectivity and longer travel times."
  * "Attention to the type of actors involved in strategy setting and policy discussions is needed to understand how issues are problematised, how specific policy instruments are chosen, and how common narratives are defined... Arts, entertainment and recreation are significant, but by no means the dominant sectors of London’s NTE. As shown in [Fig. 2](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/science/article/pii/S0965856418301381#f0010) below, arts and entertainment only account for 6.4% of the employment in the NTE, and hotels, restaurants and bars for 13.4%."
    * Furthermore, *weekend* rail services are unlikely to significantly address the needs of low-paid night-time workers outside the nightlife or entertainment industries: night-time work in lower-paid sectors such as transport and logistics, health and social care and hospitality (including cleaning) is of course distributed throughout the week.
* "The impact of opening hours on the equity of individual space–time accessibility" (Delafontaine et al, 2011) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2011.02.005
  * **Goal:** deepen our understanding about the relationship between accessibility, equity and the opening hours of public service facilities on the basis of space–time accessibility measures.
    * "Gain insights into how and to what extent equity of individual accessibility to public services can be influenced by amendments to the opening hours of service delivery."
* "Evaluating the Temporal Organization of Public Service Provision Using Space-Time Accessibility Analysis" (Neutens et al, 2010) https://doi.org/10.2747/0272-3638.31.8.1039
  * "Using space-time accessibility analysis to explore the extent to which changes in open hours affect the social equity of service provision."
  * "Our analysis not only demonstrates that access to public services exhibits substantial hour-to-hour and day-to-day variations, but it also shows that individuals with certain personal and household attributes are affected differently by changes to the temporal regime of public service facilities."
* "Beyond Space (As We Knew It): Toward Temporally Integrated Geographies of Segregation, Health, and Accessibility" (Kwan, 2013) http://dx.doi.org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/10.1080/10.045608.2013.792177
  * Considering **racial segregation**, **environmental exposure**, and **accessibility** through the lenses of time and human mobility.
  * Argues for the need to expand our analytical focus from static residential spaces to other relevant places and times in people’s everyday lives.
  * The places people can reach and at what time they can reach them (individual accessibility) are important determinants of their exposures to various social or environmental influences.
  * Mobility is an essential element of people’s spatiotemporal experiences, and these complex experiences cannot be fully understood by just looking at where people live.
* "The sustainable mobility paradigm" (Banister, 2008) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2007.10.005
  * "With respect to the work journey, travel time is important, but as travel patterns change and there is an increase in leisure-based travel, travel time may become more of a positively valued activity [...] Conventional transport analysis is based on the premise that travel is a cost, and that travel times should be as short as possible. But this is changing as the new technology allows much greater travel time flexibility, including mobile working. "
    * This dovetails with what McArthur et al. were saying about how people are blind to the experience of others with the NTE-- most workers can't mobile work (only information economy workers).
* "The social consequences of transport decision-making: clarifying concepts, synthesising knowledge, and assessing implications" (Jones & Lucas, 2012) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2012.01.012
  * "By overlooking the social impacts and social equity implications of transport decision-making at every level of the decision-making process, we are fundamentally undermining quality of life and social well-being in our towns, cities and rural settlements."
  * "Integration and consideration of the social impacts of transport planning and delivery can significantly increase the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of a number of other important areas of economic and social policy, including employment, health, education and economic development."
  * "Social outcomes under five main headings, namely: **accessibility**, **movement and activities**, **health-related**, **finance-related**, and **community-related impacts**."
  * "We believe that, by recognising that a transport-related impact may register at the same time as having economic, environmental and social outcomes, this will make it easier to pin down the precise nature of the impact, in a comprehensive manner."
* "Integrating Mobility and Urban Development Agendas: a Manifesto" (Bertolini, 2012) https://doi.org/10.1080/02513625.2012.702956
  * "Suburbanization and the growth in car use have mutually reinforced each other, as have the development of public transport and compact urbanization. The essence of this relationship is caught in what is referred to as the **transport land use feedback cycle**."
  * "Patterns of land use determine the places at which people carry out activities, namely where they live, work, engage in leisure pursuits, etc. Movements between these different locations of activity have to be taken care of by the transport system and transport system developments are intended to be adapted accordingly. In turn, transport developments determine the accessibility of locations and, with that, their attractiveness as a location for certain land use developments."
* "Does night-time public transport contribute to inclusive night mobility? Exploring Sofia's night bus network from a gender perspective" (Plyushteva & Boussauw, 2020)  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2020.01.002
  * "**The addition of a new transport service at night does not in itself promote transport equity**. Instead, the organisational, spatial, economic and social specifics of the service, often operating in highly situated ways, shape its uneven impact on the inclusion and exclusion of different groups."
  * "Examining the social inclusion implications of a new night-time transport service from a gender perspective, which covered four dimensions: safety, cost, distance and immobility (staying local or at home). [...] We aimed to demonstrate that the **gender implications of nocturnal transport provision include, but go beyond,** gendered concerns about **safety and vulnerability**."
  * "Overall, **women** in Sofia manage to sustain **comparable levels of nocturnal mobility** to those of men in terms of distances travelled, but do so **while shouldering a greater economic burden** (higher expenditure on taxis combined with lower incomes) and overcoming a **more pronounced constraint of unsafety**."
  * Recommended policy prescriptions:
    * "Night buses stopping on request can reduce the sense of vulnerability for those getting off the bus."
    * "To ensure that the night bus network serves the needs of those on lower incomes, making available travelcards which include the night service is paramount."
    * "Maintaining the job of the conductor in the face of budgetary pressures, given the conductor's important role of improving passenger safety and ensuring spontaneous boarding is possible."
    * "Formal mechanisms for continuously monitoring and evaluating the impact of the service on social inclusion are needed, as well as a continued engagement by civil society."
* “On the use of ZIP codes and ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) for the spatial analysis of epidemiological data” (Grubesic & Matisziw, 2006) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1762013/
  * "Lacking standardization and highly dynamic in structure, the use of ZIP codes and ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTA) for the spatial analysis of disease present a unique challenge to researchers."
  * "Rather than utilizing geocoded household data corresponding to individual patients, these records are aggregated to the ZIP code level for analysis. This process prevents unwanted disclosure or reconstruction of patient identity. However, it also reduces the ability for analysts to compare data across spatial units. For example, if one set of data is aggregated to census tracts and another set to ZIP codes, issues relating to the modifiable areal unit problem emerge."
  * "ZIP codes are not attributed to space in general, but rather to roads, post offices, and other facilities within the U.S. postal system."
  * "In large part, the tiling of the United States with ZIP code areas has been accomplished by various private data vendors. More recently, the U.S. Census Bureau has produced its own ZIP code topology for area based representations – ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)."
  * "It is not uncommon for postal delivery routes to be realigned or for ZIP codes to be split. More importantly, ZIP codes can be discontinued, added or expanded between months/years. "
  * "Another difficulty associated with ZIP code areas is the significant variation in geographic extent [...] the average size of a ZIP code area in Wyoming is (1,430 square kilometers), while the average size of a ZIP code area in New Jersey is 12.8 km2 [...] As a result, ZIP codes can range in size from a single building to a delivery zone spanning hundreds of square miles and crossing several political jurisdictions."
  * "**ZCTAs** can be ***discontiguous*** [...] The lack of spatial contiguity can have a dramatic impact on spatial statistical analysis, particularly if ZCTAs with a common identifier are split into different non-adjacent polygons."
* "Dasymetric Mapping and Areal Interpolation: Implementation and Evaluation" (Eicher & Brewer, 2001) https://doi.org/10.1559/152304001782173727
  * "Dasymetric maps display statistical data in meaningful spatial zones... and can be preferable to choropleth maps that show data by enumeration zones, because dasymetric zones more accurately represent underlying data distributions.
    * So we'd essentially be making the maps dasymetric by assuming where the night time transit trips are going to, based on a given variable (residential density? commercial density? open hours?) http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Dasymetric_map
  * "Consistent with their original purpose, dasymetric maps of population are still the most common type found today."
  * "**Areal interpolation** is the process of transferring spatial data from one set of units to another and is often used to compare multiple datasets, each collected using different enumeration units... Areal interpolation may be used to transfer all data to a common set of enumeration units to permit efficient comparison and analysis."
  * "Many areal interpolation methods can be incorporated into dasmetric mapping methods to improve the detail of a choropleth map below the level of the enumeration unit. The primary difference between the two approaches is that **dasmetric mapping omits** the final step of **reaggregating** to a preferred enumeration unit type."
  * "The term 'dasymetric' could be used to describe most forms of areal interpolation, especially intelligent areal interpolation methods. These techniques build from Wright's (1936) idea of reassigning data beteen units, and they incorporate his approach of using additional information to perform this operation. Chrisman (1998) suggest that Wright's technique was actually a form of areal interpolation."
  * "Though the traditional limiting variable method (P3) is over a half-century old (Wright 1936), we have shown that it can be implemented in a GIS to produce accurate dasymetric maps."
* "Because Muncie's Densities Are Not Manhattan's: Using Geographical Weighting in the EM Algorithm for Areal Interpolation" (Schroeder & Van Riper, 2013) https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12014
  * "Presents a geographically weighted expectation‐maximization (GWEM) dasymetric interpolation algorithm. Their approach expands existing EM algorithms by introducing the benefits of geographically weighted regression (GWR), which allows the densities of different control units to have a different ratio among all source units."
  * "Schroeder and Van Riper use their GWEM algorithm to interpolate historical 1980 census data backward to 1970 data with land use and land cover data as control units. It achieves better accuracy than that reported in earlier studies."
* "Spatial interpolation using areal features: A review of methods and opportunities using new forms of data with coded illustrations" (Comber & Zeng, 2019) https://doi.org/10.1111/gec3.12465
  * "Choices for areal interpolation are limited if the source zones and their attributes are the only information available. [... The areal weighting approach] allocates the source zone attributes proportionately to the target zones based on the area of their intersection."
  * "[Pycnophylactic interpolation] iteratively interpolates the source zone attribute to the target zones in order to avoid sharp discontinuities between neighbouring target zones aims, whilst preserving the overall mass or volume of the counts in the source zones."
    * Invented by Tobler (1979)
    * Each iteration tries to improve the smoothness of adjacent target zone values across study area by adjusting the allocation to each target zone, whilst preserving the target zone total (also referred to as mass or volume), using the weighted average of target zone nearest neighbours.
  * "Dasymetric approaches can either identify areas to include/exclude from the interpolation process. Population data, for example, are excluded from nonresidential areas. [...] The simplest dasymetric approach is to create binary masks of areas that are included or excluded from the interpolation process."

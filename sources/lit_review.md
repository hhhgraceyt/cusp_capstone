## Literature Review

* "Socio-spatial and temporal dimensions of transport equity for London's night time economy" (McArthur, Robin, Smeds 2019) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.024
  * Goal: **inform a more rigorous mode of operationalising transport equity through sustainable and just transport planning.**
    * This paper centres on the recent introduction of Night Tube (London Underground) weekend services along selected routes to support the Night Time Economy (NTE), taking a different perspective on the NTE than most literature published to date, as it focuses on NTE workers.
    * Critical of "‘London at night’ as a vehicle for economic development, focusing on the consumption-side of the economy and improving individuals’ access to entertainment and recreation."
  * "Night-time workers face severe accessibility barriers, often relying on low-frequency bus services that have inadequate service coverage across Greater London... some social groups travel predominately during off-peak hours and are thus underserved by lower frequency services, with poor connectivity and longer travel times."
  * "Attention to the type of actors involved in strategy setting and policy discussions is needed to understand how issues are problematised, how specific policy instruments are chosen, and how common narratives are defined... Arts, entertainment and recreation are significant, but by no means the dominant sectors of London’s NTE. As shown in [Fig. 2](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/science/article/pii/S0965856418301381#f0010) below, arts and entertainment only account for 6.4% of the employment in the NTE, and hotels, restaurants and bars for 13.4%."
    * Furthermore, *weekend* rail services are unlikely to significantly address the needs of low-paid night-time workers outside the nightlife or entertainment industries: night-time work in lower-paid sectors such as transport and logistics, health and social care and hospitality (including cleaning) is of course distributed throughout the week.
* "The impact of opening hours on the equity of individual space–time accessibility" (Delafontaine et al, 2011) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2011.02.005
  * **Goal:** deepen our understanding about the relationship between accessibility, equity and the opening hours of public service facilities on the basis of space–time accessibility measures.
  * Three approaches based on different equity principles presented to schedule the opening hours of public service facilities: **utilitarian**, **egalitarian**, & **distributive**.
